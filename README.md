# üìö **Communities Web App**

This is a **web application** built with **Python, Django**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to create and participate in communities based on various interests such as hobbies, study groups, and job-related topics. Users can join these communities, create posts, leave comments, and update their profiles.

For example, in a **Django community**, a user might post an issue they face (e.g., trouble installing the Django framework). Other members of the community, who are subscribed, can view and help by leaving comments to provide solutions.
